## *Introduction* 

This is the setup that I have been working on, I started using NeoVim and Vim at the start of 2019, and can not stop trying make the best Config/ workflow I have a problem, here is what I have so far.

- ![tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)(a terminal multiplexer.)<br>
- ![zsh](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/12a1558a4b408b3b2b7e) (a better shell, command line IMO) <br>
- ![oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) it's kind of a plugin manger, but more.<br>  
- ![Neovim](https://neovim.io/) a text editor, Neovim seems to come with a bit more common sense defaults and is pretty easy to install plugins.
